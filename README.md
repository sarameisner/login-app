# login-app

\*\*\* we built this small app in class it shows the basics of:

- sign up - create a user > data is saved in the database

- log in - enter email + password > check in DB

- home page - only visible when you are logged in

- log out - clears session, back button won't work

\*\*\* what we practiced today in class:

- validating inputs (length, regex for email, etc.)

- .strip() to remove unwanted spaces

- password hashing so we never store the real password

- sessions to remember who is logged in

- @no_cache so you can't see pages after logging out

- using correct http status codes (200, 400, 500)
